# Blake the BloodHound Replicator

Blake will become the Red Teamer's best friend. Blake will take the ZIP output from one of the BloodHound collectors and re-create that environment and permissions into a target environment.

## Usage

Coming soon!

## Why

Red Teamers often want to test attacks and tools against their target organization before conducting the attack in the target's environment. This is difficult as an Active Directory evironment you build will have different users, groups, domains, etc. 

However, most Red Teamers often run "BloodHound" to get a lay of the land. What if you could take that data and replicate all the collected data in a lab environment before running in the actual attack? Well, with Blake, now you can!
